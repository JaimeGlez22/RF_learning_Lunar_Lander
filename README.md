# Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning system using neuroevolution techniques and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for the Lunar Lander game, available on [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

## Repository Content

- [`Neuroevolutivos/`](https://github.com/JaimeGlez22/RF_learning_Lunar_Lander/tree/main/Neuroevolutivos): contains the Jupyter Notebook for the implementation and test of the reinforcement learning using neuroevolution techniques.
- [`DQN/`](https://github.com/JaimeGlez22/RF_learning_Lunar_Lander/tree/main/DQN): contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the implementation and test of the reinforcement learning using Deep Q-Network algorithm.
